Notes on this script:

The find_best_symbol() function would ideally be a machine learning algorithm that would return the best
symbol to trade for a 30 minute long period. Updates to come.

There is a lack of a slippage model, hence rendering the algorithm inacurate compared to theoretial profits evaluated in
the arbitrage() function.

This algorithm has been decomissioned indefinetly from my personal trading strategies due to the lack of a slippage model.

I am currently running a market making algo on GDAX, which will not be posted on git hub unless decommisioned.
